# stable_unimodular_triples
Let R be a polynomial ring R in three variables x, y, z over a finite field.  Our first goal is to define a degrevlex-based total order on R.  Next, we aim to find all stable unimodular triples over R whose entries have total degrees bounded above by some fixed number.  For each such triple (f, g, h), we produce elements a, b in R for which (f+ah, g+bh) is unimodular and for which a has minimum total degree.
