# stable_unimodular_triples
Let R be a polynomial ring in three variables x, y, z over a field of prime cardinality.  Our first goal is to define a degrevlex-based total order on R.  Next, we aim to find all stable unimodular triples over R whose entries have total degrees bounded above by some fixed number.  For each such triple (f, g, h), we wish to produce elements a, b in R for which (f+ah, g+bh) is unimodular, for which a has minimum total degree, and for which b has minimum total degree given the choice of a.  So far, we have achieved only the first goal.
